                         • Please upload an image of any evidence of your alumni status, and additionally \n
                         • Mention your LinkedIn address in the Remarks column \n \n
                        This app has following features: \n \n

                         1. It is developed as a social initiative to connect alumni of leading institutes of engineering, medicine, management, research, law and others. (IITs, AIIMSs, IIMs, NLUs, IISERs etc). We expect that by December 2023 it will be a community of over 1 lac alumni of prestigious institutes. \n
                         2. The development and running expenses of this app and platform are financed by a charitable trust created for this purpose. It is well-funded by contributions from various alumni. The basic connectivity and networking to of alumni is committed to be a free for lifetime for all institutes as it is backed up by this well-funded trust. \n
                         3. The privacy of close community of your institute will be maintained at the same time where all members will have option to collaborate and connect to the larger world for professional or personal reasons \n
                         4. It is our endeavour that it will essentially remain a self-governed community with the help of algorithms and automatic rules rather than manual intervention which will be extremely rare \n
                        As you are aware, the Alumni Relay app is expiring on August 20, 2023 and the WhatsApp community Thomasonian Worldwide has also reached its limits for members. You are requested to fill up the form urgently so that no one is left out of this community app.</string>
